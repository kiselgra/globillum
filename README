NOTES ON THE HEADLESS VERSION
=============================
That is ./src/gi.

If your terminal get corrupted after a crash this is because the scheme
interpreter changes some terminal properties which are not reset on crash.

Example command line
--------------------
$ ./src/gi /home/kai/render-data/models/sponza.noflag.obj -r 1024x720 -c nogui.scm -c sponza.lights.scm

This loads the model and executes the default renderer right away. Use -l (ell)
to not render directly, leaving you the chance to make settings at the repl.
